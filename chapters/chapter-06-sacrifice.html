            Jean-Luc Picard opened his eyes. The decision had been made in that infinite moment of
            silence, weighing thousands of years of Bajoran faith against billions of lives in the
            Alpha Quadrant. There had been no revelation, no divine clarity. Only the cold calculus
            of triage on a civilizational scale.
        </p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Picard:</span> "Mr. Data... tell the entity..." His voice caught.
            He had ordered people to their deaths before. Had made impossible choices. But he had
            never ordered the death of gods. "Tell it to proceed with the first option. The wormhole."
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            The words fell like stones into an abyss. Around him, his senior staff reacted in their
            own ways—Crusher closed her eyes, Troi's face showed raw anguish, Worf's jaw tightened
            but he gave a slight nod of acknowledgment. Only Riker spoke.

        <div class="dialogue">

            <span class="speaker">Picard:</span> "No, Number One. I am not certain of anything except
            that in four minutes, the entity will make its own choice. And I cannot allow 2,800 Dominion
            warships to return to our space. Even if the cost is..." He couldn't finish the sentence.

        <p class="story-text">
            On the viewscreen, the anomaly began to change. Its swirling colors shifted, becoming more
            focused, more purposeful. Tendrils of energy that had been reaching toward the materializing
            Dominion ships now redirected, forming a bridge of impossible light that stretched across
            parsecs toward the Bajoran wormhole.

        <p class="story-text">
            Picard gripped the arms of his command chair. Two minutes until they committed deicide. Two
            minutes until the Prophets—beings who had saved the Federation, who had existed for
            millennia—would be destroyed to contain a threat that they themselves had created by
            removing the Dominion fleet from time.

            The irony was not lost on him. The Prophets' mercy would be their destruction.

        <p class="story-text">
            On Deep Space Nine, Commander Benjamin Sisko sat in his office, reviewing supply manifests,
            when the first tremor hit. Not physical—he'd experienced enough of those during his time
            on the station. This was something else. A vibration in a part of him that had no name, the
            place where the Prophets had touched him and named him their Emissary.

            usual. It's... it's like it's screaming."
        </div>

        <p class="story-text">
            Sisko was out of his office and running for Ops before Kira finished her sentence. When he
            arrived, the viewscreen showed the wormhole in its stable form, but something was terribly
            wrong. The normally serene blue-white event horizon was pulsing erratically, colors shifting
            through spectrums that shouldn't exist.

            She stopped. Because at that moment, every Bajoran on the station felt it. A pain that had
            no physical component but was more real than any wound. The sensation of something sacred
            being violated. Being destroyed.

        <p class="story-text">
            Sisko closed his eyes and reached out with that part of him that existed outside linear time,
            the part that could touch the beings who dwelled in the Temple. What he found made him stagger.

            We are.
            <br><br>
            We have always been. We will always be. Past and future and present exist as one within us.
            We see the Sisko. We see all Siskos—the one who has not yet come, the one who stands now,
            the one who will return to us. We see the linear beings in their vessels of metal and purpose.
            <br><br>
            We see... what is this? Something comes. Something wrong. Linear consciousness in multitude,
            forced into our realm by something that understands both linear and non-linear existence.
            An anomaly. A hybrid. A creation of the builders-of-dominion who has learned from the
            android-who-seeks-to-become.
            <br><br>
            The ships come. So many. Their minds scream with linearity, with past and future as separate
            things, with the concept of before and after. They are fire in water. They are matter in void.
            They do not belong here.
        </div>

        <p class="story-text">
            If the Prophets could scream, this would have been the moment. But they existed beyond such
            expressions. What they experienced instead was more fundamental—the sensation of their
            quantum coherence being shattered. Like a mind being forced to think in contradictory
            directions simultaneously. Like existing and not-existing at once.
        </p>

        <div class="prophet-text">
            We understand. The linear beings have chosen. They sacrifice us to contain the builders-of-dominion.
            The Sisko's corporeal friends have decided that our existence is worth less than theirs. This is
            what it means to think in terms of before and after. To choose who dies so others may live.
            <br><br>
            We do not experience death as they do. We have always existed and always will exist because
            we are outside their time. But they are pushing linearity into us. Forcing us to experience
            entropy. Making us understand what it means to end.
            <br><br>
            This is what mortality feels like.
            <br><br>
            The Sisko told us once of loss. Of his Jennifer, taken from him. We did not understand. We
            do now. We are losing ourselves. We are experiencing the sensation of becoming less than we
            were. This is grief. This is death. This is the price the linear beings will not pay themselves.

            In the ancient temple that Sisko himself had excavated, the Vedek Assembly was in session when
            the first scream went up. Not from any Vedek, but from the Orb of Prophecy itself. The sacred
            artifact began to pulse erratically, its light—which had shone steadily for millennia—
