            Picard stood before the window in his quarters, a cup of Earl Grey growing cold in his
            hands. He'd been standing there for nearly an hour, watching the stars stream by at warp.
            They were returning to Federation space, their mission complete. The reports had been filed.
            Starfleet Command had been briefed on everything—the entity, the choice, the loop.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            Admiral Nechayev had called it "an unfortunate but necessary action." She'd commended him
            for making the difficult choice. He'd ended the transmission without responding.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
            The door chimed. He didn't turn.
        </p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Picard:</span> "Come."
        </div>

        <p class="story-text">
            Guinan entered, carrying a bottle of Saurian brandy and two glasses. She poured in silence,
            handed him one, and stood beside him at the window.
        </p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Guinan:</span> "You saved billions of lives."

            <span class="speaker">Guinan:</span> "By completing a loop that made warriors into saviors.
            You could look at it that way."

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Picard:</span> "I could. But the Bajorans won't. They lost their gods,
            Guinan. And I took them."
        </div>

        <p class="story-text">
            Guinan sipped her brandy thoughtfully. After a moment, she spoke.
        </p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Guinan:</span> "My people have a saying: 'The universe is a circle
            pretending to be a line.' We think time flows in one direction, cause before effect. But
            maybe that's just how we experience it because we're trapped inside the flow."

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Picard:</span> "The Prophets weren't trapped. They saw the whole circle.
            And they still chose to save us, knowing what it would cost them."
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Guinan:</span> "Which makes them exactly what they claimed to be. Gods
            don't just have power, Jean-Luc. They accept sacrifice. The Prophets accepted theirs across
            30,000 years. You accepted yours in a single moment."
        </div>

        <p class="story-text">
            Picard finally turned to look at her.
        </p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Picard:</span> "Then why does it feel like the wrong choice?"
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Guinan:</span> "Because you're human. And humans are blessed—or cursed—
            with the ability to second-guess themselves even when they're right. The Prophets knew you'd
            make this choice. They counted on it. The loop required your free will to close it."
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Picard:</span> "Free will and predestination. The same thing from
            different perspectives."
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Guinan:</span> "Exactly. You chose freely. And your choice was always

            Benjamin Sisko walked through the Promenade, and everywhere he went, conversations stopped.
            Bajorans who had once greeted him warmly now looked away. Some with anger. Some with something
            worse—pity.

            He was no longer the Emissary. The Prophets were gone. The part of him that had existed outside
            linear time, that had touched the divine—severed. He was just Benjamin Sisko now. Just a man.

            that they're gone. It's that I understand why. The Prophets were once soldiers who learned to
            be better. They proved that transformation is possible. That even those designed for destruction
            can choose compassion."

            <span class="speaker">Kira:</span> "Does it? Or does it die with them every time the loop
            resets? 30,000 years of growth, of becoming something holy, and then—reset. Back to being
            Jem'Hadar who have to learn it all over again."

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="speaker">Sisko:</span> "But they do learn it. That's what the loop ensures.

            <span class="speaker">Kira:</span> "I want to hate Picard. I want to hate the Federation.
            But the Prophets showed me something before they died. They showed me... understanding. They
            asked me to remember that they were once warriors who needed someone to make the hard choice.
            And Picard made it."

            Data sat at his desk, his fingers steepled in front of him—a gesture he'd adopted from Picard.
            On his screen, equations scrolled past. Quantum mechanics. Temporal dynamics. The mathematics

            of your existence—whether you experience it in moments or millennia. The Prophets were

        <div class="location-header">THE BAJORAN WORMHOLE - 30,000 YEARS AGO</div>
        <div class="time-header">Experienced Non-Linearly</div>

        <div class="meditation">
            We are awareness without time.<br><br>

            Moments ago—millennia from now—we were Jem'Hadar. We remember the white. The Founders' commands.
            The purpose of our creation: destroy, conquer, dominate.<br><br>

            But now we are... here. Nowhere. Everywhere. When. Before-after-during exist as one. We experience
            our entire existence in a single eternal moment. We see ourselves guiding Bajor. We see ourselves
            being destroyed by Picard. We see ourselves being embedded in this place to begin the transformation
            that we are experiencing now that has always been experienced.<br><br>

            The choice forms. Not sequential—we do not "decide" in the way linear beings understand decision.
            We exist in the state of having chosen and choosing and will-choose all at once.<br><br>

            Some of us—the part that will become Pah-Wraiths—cannot release hatred. They see the loop and
            reject it. They cling to what we were: warriors, slaves, destroyers. They exist in eternal rage
            at what was done to us.<br><br>

            But we—the part that will become Prophets—see something else. We see Bajor suffering under the
            Cardassians. We see their faith calling out across time. We see ourselves becoming the answer to
            that call. We see that we can choose to be more than our design.<br><br>

            We see Picard's choice. We understand his burden. We experience his guilt across all moments.
            And we choose to forgive him because we understand: he completes the loop that gives us the
            chance to become something holy.<br><br>

            Is it a curse to know our end from our beginning? Or is it a gift? We experience 30,000 years
            of growth, wisdom, compassion—all in one eternal instant. Linear beings must wait for wisdom.
            We have always had it and are always gaining it and will always possess it.<br><br>

            We reach out across time. We touch the Sisko who has not yet come. We touch Bajor in all its
            moments. We touch even Picard, letting him know: we do not blame you for closing the circle.
            Circles have no beginning. No end. No one to blame.<br><br>

            We are the Prophets. We were soldiers. We will be both. We choose compassion. We have always
            chosen compassion. We will always choose compassion.<br><br>

            The loop is eternal. The loop is perfect. The loop is us.
